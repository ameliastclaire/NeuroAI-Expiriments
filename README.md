# NeuroAI Experiments

**Owner:** Amelia St. Claire  
**Repository:** [NeuroAI-Experiments](https://github.com/ameliastclaire/AmeliasPortfolio/tree/main/NeuroAI-Experiments)

## Overview

Welcome to the NeuroAI Experiments repository! This repository serves as a space for experimenting with artificial intelligence and neural networks to model psychological and cognitive processes.

## Experiments

### 1. Experiment 1: User Reaction Prediction
**Description:** In this experiment, we aim to predict user reactions based on input stimuli. We'll train a neural network to analyze sensory input and predict potential emotional responses.
**Notebook:** [experiment1.ipynb](https://github.com/ameliastclaire/AmeliasPortfolio/tree/main/NeuroAI-Experiments/experiment1/experiment1.ipynb)

### 2. Experiment 2: Cognitive Process Simulation
**Description:** Simulating cognitive processes using AI models. We'll explore how neural networks can mimic decision-making and problem-solving in different scenarios.
**Notebook:** [experiment2.ipynb](https://github.com/ameliastclaire/AmeliasPortfolio/tree/main/NeuroAI-Experiments/experiment2/experiment2.ipynb)

### 3. Experiment 3: Emotion Recognition
**Description:** Training a neural network to recognize emotions from facial expressions. This experiment focuses on bridging the gap between psychological emotions and AI understanding.
**Notebook:** [experiment3.ipynb](https://github.com/ameliastclaire/AmeliasPortfolio/tree/main/NeuroAI-Experiments/experiment3/experiment3.ipynb)

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The experiments are conducted using Python programming language and various machine learning libraries.

- **TensorFlow:** TensorFlow is utilized for building and training neural networks.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the experiments' notebooks to understand the intersection between artificial intelligence and psychology.
