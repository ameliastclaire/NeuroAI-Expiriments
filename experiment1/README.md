# Experiment 1: User Reaction Prediction

**Owner:** Amelia St. Claire  
**Repository:** [NeuroAI-Experiments](https://github.com/ameliastclaire/AmeliasPortfolio/tree/main/NeuroAI-Experiments)

## Overview

Welcome to Experiment 1 of the NeuroAI Experiments repository! In this experiment, we aim to predict user reactions based on input stimuli. The goal is to train a neural network to analyze sensory input and predict potential emotional responses.

## Notebook

The main content of this experiment can be found in the Jupyter Notebook provided below:

- **Experiment 1 Notebook:** [experiment1.ipynb](https://github.com/ameliastclaire/AmeliasPortfolio/tree/main/NeuroAI-Experiments/experiment1/experiment1.ipynb)

## Experiment Details

- **Dataset:** The dataset used in this experiment contains various sensory inputs and corresponding emotional reactions.

- **Model:** We'll build a deep neural network using TensorFlow to learn patterns in the data and make predictions.

- **Evaluation:** The trained model's performance will be evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict emotional responses from input stimuli.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the notebook to understand the experiment's setup, methodology, and results.

## Contribution

Contributions to this experiment are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the experiment, alternative approaches, or insights related to user reactions and neural networks, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
