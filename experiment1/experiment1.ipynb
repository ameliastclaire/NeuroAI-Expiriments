# Experiment 1: User Reaction Prediction

## Introduction

In this experiment, we aim to predict user reactions based on input stimuli. We'll use a neural network to analyze sensory input and predict potential emotional responses.

## Dataset

Describe the dataset you're using for this experiment, including its structure and contents.

## Data Preprocessing

Outline the steps taken to preprocess the dataset, including normalization, splitting into training and testing sets, etc.

## Neural Network Architecture

Describe the architecture of the neural network used for this experiment. Specify the number of layers, activation functions, and any other relevant details.

## Model Training

Provide the code and explanation for training the neural network on the dataset.

## Model Evaluation

Explain how you evaluate the trained model's performance, including metrics used and their interpretation.

## Predictions

Provide code for making predictions using the trained model and show some example predictions.

## Discussion

Discuss the results obtained from the experiment. Interpret the predictions and discuss any insights gained.

## Conclusion

Summarize the findings of the experiment and its implications for the intersection of AI and psychology.

## Next Steps

Outline any potential next steps, improvements, or further experiments based on the outcomes of this experiment.
